# 📈 Machine Learning Sales Forecasting for Inventory Planning

## Overview  
This project leverages **historical daily sales data (2020–2025)** to build a **365-day sales forecast**.  
The main objective is to support **inventory and purchasing planning**, ensuring the client orders the right amount of goods at the right time.  

The analysis highlights two key patterns in the data:  
- 📈 A **strong upward growth trend** in sales.  
- 🎄 A **clear seasonal spike** during the **November/December holiday period**.

## 🔑 Key Deliverables & Analysis  

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Time series plots to visualize long-term growth.  
- Seasonal heatmaps to confirm yearly demand cycles.  
- Decomposition analysis to separate **trend, seasonality, and residuals**.  

### 2. Forecasting Models Compared  
- **Facebook Prophet**  
  - Captures long-term growth.  
  - Provides **confidence intervals** (expected min/max).  
- **Exponential Smoothing (Holt-Winters)**  
  - Serves as a robust baseline.  
  - Accurately models **yearly seasonal spikes**.  

### 3. Actionable Output  
- Predictions exported into **Excel files**:  
  - **Daily forecast** (next 365 days).  
  - **Monthly summary** (aggregated for easier purchasing decisions).
